This is Our World of Pixels, based off of Our/Your World of Text and World of Minimalism. Above is the source code. Since the game is coded in Lua/Love2D, it's pretty easy to "compile". Simple package everything up in a zip file, then rename it from .zip to .love and drag it on top of love.exe. You can find love2D here - https://love2d.org/

If you have any ideas, leave a suggestion, or if you'd like, feel free to make a pull req as well. I'll try to keep my code super well documented.
